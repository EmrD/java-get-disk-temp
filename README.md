## Getting Started

With this project, you can learn your disk temperatures locally. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- On your desktop you must see your .csv file that named "output". This is a temp file and you can ignore or set the visible property to hidden.
- On project's src path; you must see the GetDiskInfo.ps1 file. This file gets the temperatures from S.M.A.R.T data. This file is running automatically.
- To run this project, your disks must send S.M.A.R.T data. Please check compatibility.
